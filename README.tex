\section*{Finding the Three Most Frequent Elements in an Array}

\textbf{Time limit:} $1$ second \\
\textbf{Memory limit:} $256$ MB

\subsection*{Problem Statement}

An array $a$ consisting of $n$ numbers is given.

Find three \textbf{distinct} elements of this array
\[
x_1, x_2, x_3
\]
such that the \textbf{total number of their occurrences} in the array is maximized.

If there are several suitable triples
\[
(x_1, x_2, x_3),
\]
output the triple with the \textbf{minimum sum}
\[
x_1 + x_2 + x_3.
\]

It is guaranteed that the array contains at least three distinct elements.

\subsection*{Input Format}

The first line contains a single integer
\[
n,
\]
the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains $n$ integers
\[
a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n,
\]
where $a_i$ is the element at position $i$ in the array $a$.

\subsection*{Constraints}

\[
1 \le n \le 10^5
\]

\[
1 \le a_i \le 10^5 \quad \text{for all } 1 \le i \le n
\]

\subsection*{Output Format}

Output three integers
\[
x_1, x_2, x_3
\]
separated by spaces and printed in \textbf{increasing order}.

\subsection*{Examples}

\subsubsection*{Example 1}

Input:
\[
n = 6
\]
\[
a = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1)
\]

Output:
\[
1\ 2\ 3
\]

\subsubsection*{Example 2}

Input:
\[
n = 6
\]
\[
a = (3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3)
\]

Output:
\[
1\ 2\ 3
\]

\subsubsection*{Example 3}

Input:
\[
n = 8
\]
\[
a = (11, 21, 31, 41, 31, 41, 11, 21)
\]

Output:
\[
11\ 21\ 31
\]
